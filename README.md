## 🎯 About

This project provides real-time monitoring and historical tracking of the Australian Federal Government's operational status. It demonstrates a fundamental difference between governmental systems:

### 🇺🇸 United States
Government shutdowns occur when Congress fails to pass funding legislation, causing non-essential services to cease operation and federal employees to be furloughed.

### 🇦🇺 Australia
Under the Westminster parliamentary system, traditional "shutdowns" cannot occur. If Parliament cannot pass supply (budget) bills, it triggers either a change of government or a general election, but essential services continue operating.
