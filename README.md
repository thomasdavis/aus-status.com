# 🇦🇺 Australia Status

A Next.js application that monitors Australian Federal Government uptime, inspired by [usa-status.com](https://usa-status.com).

## About

This project replicates the design and concept of usa-status.com but for Australia. It demonstrates an important difference between the US Congressional system and Australia's Westminster parliamentary system:

- **USA**: Government shutdowns can occur when Congress fails to pass funding legislation
- **Australia**: The Westminster system prevents traditional "shutdowns" - if Parliament cannot pass supply bills, it triggers either a change of government or an election, but services continue operating

## Features

- 🎨 Clean, modern UI using Tailwind CSS
- 📊 Visual uptime history timeline

- 🖱️ Interactive month tooltips
- ⚡ Built with Next.js 15 and React 19
